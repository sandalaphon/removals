Surveyor Algorithm Notes:

1. Presume survey takes 30 minutes?
2. Get distance as crow flies between all scheduled appointments and the potential appointment.
3. Exclude un-availble slots (i.e. those which are bookended by other appointments)
4. Available appointment slots in the next 3 days (default is 3 days, can be changed) listed by distance, and drive-time.
5. Appointments furthest from depot to be scheduled mid journey. To allow en route appointments (unless enroute to or from work for a surveyor)
6. Get surveyor's home postcode. (Do they accept early morning or after work appointments?)
7. Add annual leave to database...what is the best configuration...datetime booleans?




Make journeys that are less than 15 minutes show as green.
